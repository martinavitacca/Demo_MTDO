                    Six, a nine-year-old girl in a yellow raincoat, awakens from a dream of a woman wearing a kimono and a Noh mask. Armed
                    with only a lighter, she sneaks through the bowels of the Maw, a massive, underwater iron vessel. Throughout the Maw,
                    she encounters Nomes: small, skittish creatures that either flee from her or passively observe her efforts. She has the
                    option to hug the Nomes, should she get close to one. In the Prison, where captured children are held, Six evades the
                    carnivorous Leeches that infest its depths and artificial eyes that will turn her to stone if she is caught in their
                    lights. Six also regularly experiences debilitating bouts of hunger; whenever she eats, a shadowy, flickering version of
                    herself appears. After eating some meat that was left over in a cage, Six is captured by the blind, long-armed Janitor
                    who supervises the captured children. She escapes but makes no effort to help the other children. She falls into a room
                    filled with piles of shoes and evades the unseen monster moving underneath. The Janitor eventually corners Six, but she
                    severs his arms with a collapsing door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Caught by another bout of hunger, Six is forced to eat a live rat. She travels to the Kitchen, where children wrapped up
                    in butcher paper are being sent. Here, the grotesque Twin Chefs are preparing a feast and pursue Six whenever they spot
                    her. She makes her way outside to the hull of the Maw, above the ocean waves. Scaling the hull, Six witnesses a
                    procession of obese, suited Guests marching into the Maw from their vessel. They lumber into the Japanese-style Guest
                    Area, where they gorge themselves on food. The feast is overseen by the mysterious Lady from Six's dream, the masked
                    proprietress of the Maw. Several Guests scramble after Six, but she outruns them. When she has another hunger attack, a
                    Nome offers her a sausage. However, Six eats the Nome instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Six follows the Lady up into her Quarters, which are strewn with broken mirrors. Pursued by the Lady, Six finds an
                    unbroken mirror, which she uses to repel her. The sight of her own reflection causes the Lady pain and subdues her. As
                    the Lady lies defenseless, Six experiences a final hunger attack. She bites the Lady's neck, killing her and absorbing
                    her magical powers. Six walks back through the Guest Area, surrounded by a dark aura. Some of the Guests try to eat her,
                    but their lives are instantly drained and their necks snapped by her new powers. She passes through a door and proceeds
                    up a staircase and out into the sunlight, while all the Nomes she has hugged gather at the open doorway. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    In a post-credits scene, Six waits by the entrance of the Maw while a foghorn is heard in the distance.
